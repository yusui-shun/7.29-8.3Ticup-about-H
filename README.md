# 7.29-8.3Ticup-about-H
This is a record about my 5 days for the Ticup in chongqing. Our team decide a easy plan about the mission. We use the 
stepper motor to control the car and finish the task.
but the task4 is difficult and you should make the better control system to finish it.
for us ,our easy plan is hard to do and we use the stupid stretegy want to do it.
it's very useless and wasting our time.
But not bad ,because we will get the prize maybe first or second. it fixes my regret in my first year in college.
